<b>Welcome to your new job here at the Factory!<br>
This job is fairly easy,<br>
all you have to do is keep an eye out to make sure nobody<br>
tries to break into the Factory and mess with any of the wires,<br>
machinery... You get what I mean.<br>
Now, there has been other Toons working here<br>
before but they just... POOF! Disappeared! Without a word,<br>
they didn't even come to me for their 1 Jellybean-a-month paycheck!<br>
Ah, well, perhaps they got a little too bored working here and quit without notice.<br>
There has been reports of strange things happening here in the Factory,<br>
some say that they were attacked by the Skeletons of the unbuilt Cogs.<br>
They may be hunting for you so I would be careful. Apart from that I'm sure you'll do a good job here.<br>
Thanks for taking your time to work here at The Factory as a Security Guard.<br></b>

<p>Disclaimer: I do not own any of the models/textures/sounds in the game and I am not making money off of this, I simply made this out of boredom.<br>
This was put together by the Toontown House Team and made into an MSI installer by Louie Picklezilla.<br>
The Mac port was made by B.D. Pinkermash, the assistant developer of Toontown Offline.</p>
