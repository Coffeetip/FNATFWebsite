<b>Welcome to your new job here at the Factory!<br>
This job is fairly easy,<br>
all you have to do is keep an eye out to make sure nobody<br>
tries to break into the Factory and mess with any of the wires,<br>
machinery... You get what I mean.<br>
Now, there has been other Toons working here<br>
before but they just... POOF! Disappeared! Without a word,<br>
they didn't even come to me for their 1 Jellybean-a-month paycheck!<br>
Ah, well, perhaps they got a little too bored working here and quit without notice.<br>
There has been reports of strange things happening here in the Factory,<br>
some say that they were attacked by the Skeletons of the unbuilt Cogs.<br>
They may be hunting for you so I would be careful. Apart from that I'm sure you'll do a good job here.<br>
Thanks for taking your time to work here at The Factory as a Security Guard.<br></b>

<p>Disclaimer: I do not own any of the models/textures/sounds in the game and I am not making money off of this, I simply made this out of boredom. This was put together by the Toontown House Team and made into an MSI installer by Louie Picklezilla.
The Mac port was made by B.D. Pinkermash, the assistant developer of Toontown Offline.</p>
